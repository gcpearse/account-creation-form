# Account Creation Form

## Overview

This is a small project built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, allowing a user to create an account for a travel website.

Once the user has successfully submitted their information, they are taken to a new page to view their account details.

This is a standalone mini project built to help me explore the DOM and basic CSS styling. It is not intended to serve as the basis for a larger application.
